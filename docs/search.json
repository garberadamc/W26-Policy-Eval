The program evaluation methods presented will aim at identifying and measuring the causal effect of policies, regulations, and interventions on environmental outcomes of interest. Students will learn the research designs and methods for estimating causal effects with experimental and non-experimental data. This will prepare the students for interpreting and conducting high-quality empirical research, with applications in cross-sectional data and panel data settings."

    "text": "There are many different ways to create tidy tables in R. You might be familiar with the kable function from {knitr} that creates tables for rectangular data. Kable tables don’t have a ton of flexibility, but are great at producing clean, simple tables. As we move into creating tables for the many different statistical models we will learn in this course, we will need to move beyond a simple kable table. That is where {gt} comes in!

    "text": "There are many different ways to create tidy tables in R. You might be familiar with the kable function from {knitr} that creates tables for rectangular data. Kable tables don’t have a ton of flexibility, but are great at producing clean, simple tables. As we move into creating tables for the many different statistical models we will learn in this course, we will need to move beyond a simple kable table. That is where {gt} comes in!
